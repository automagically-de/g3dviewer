Finally there is texture support. For now it includes the Quick3D plugin, the
newly created AC3D plugin and with some quirks the 3DS plugin. Two new image
plugins have been created, one for SGI RGB files and a general image loading
plugin based on GdkPixbuf (GTK 2.x only).
The code has been cleaned up a lot and there will be more cleanups until the
final 0.2.0 release.
The removal of the GTK 1.2 interface has been postponed to 0.3.0.
